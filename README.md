# LittleHelpMVC

This app is created by the HOA of a subdivision for its residents. 
This app will help the residents to obtain contact information of 
the service providers like handymen, plumbers, lawn mowers, babysitters, housekeepers etc.

Users: Users can view the list of services available, when the user clicks on a particular service, 
he/she can view the information about the service providers that offer the particular service the user clicked.

Service Providers: The existing service providers can log in with their user id and password 
and they can update their information in the database. The new service providers have to sign up 
first to enter the details of the service they provide.

Admin: The Admin maintains the LittleHelp database, the Admin has access to delete a service provider entry, 
the Admin has access to add an category to the database and the admin has right to reset the service providerâ€™s password.
